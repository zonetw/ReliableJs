How to Run the Sample Code

-----------------------
---


The files come in trios tied together by a sequence number, nn, which is 01, 02 or 03.

- DiContainer_nn.js is a subject under test.
- DiContainer_nn_tests.js contains the tests.
- index_nn.js is the HTML file that runs the tests with Jasmine.

The exception is DiContainer_03b.js, which is a small fix to DiContainer_03.js, as explained in the chapter.

The final version has no 'nn' suffix. DiContainer.js is tested by DiContainer_tests.js using index.html.

To run a trio, just open index_nn.html in your web browser.
