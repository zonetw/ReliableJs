How to Run the Sample Code
--------------------------

Index.html is set up to run the tests in Listing_01_tests.js, with Listing_01.js containing the subject under test. You can execute the tests by loading index.html in your browser.

The tests will also pass if you change index.html to reference Listing_02.js instead of Listing_01.js.
