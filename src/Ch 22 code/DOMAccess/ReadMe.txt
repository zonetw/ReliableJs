How to Run the Sample Code
--------------------------

inline.html contains an example of mixed JavaScript and HTML

The clickCoundDisplay files come in trios tied together by a sequence number, nn, which is 01, 02 or 03.

- clickCountDisplay_nn.js is a subject under test.
- clickCountDisplay_nn_tests.js contains the tests.
- index_nn.js is the HTML file that runs the tests with Jasmine.

To run a trio, just open index_nn.html in your web browser.
